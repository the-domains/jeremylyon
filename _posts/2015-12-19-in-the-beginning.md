Putting up a personal website has been on my oft-neglected to do list for a while. But my old school (ca. 2001), artisanal, hand-crafted HTML skillz aren't going to make a site of a quality I'm willing to inscribe my name on. So when I heard about the Grid (and got an early-days demo) I was pretty excited to try it out. It's been a long time coming, but you're reading this now because it's finally arrived.
